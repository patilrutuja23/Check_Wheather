This repository contains my project of real time Weather checking.
<br>
This is a simple Weather API application that allows users to check the current weather of any city using real-time data. The app fetches weather information from the OpenWeather API and displays it in an easy-to-read format.

# Tech Stack:
**JavaScript**: Handles the logic for fetching data from the OpenWeather API and displaying it dynamically.
<br>
**CSS**: Provides styling for a clean and responsive UI.
<br>
**HTML**: Structures the webpage with necessary elements like search input, weather details, and error messages.
<br>
